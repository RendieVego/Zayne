    <span class="line" style="text-align: left;">Documentary filmmaking often faces significant financial hurdles. Securing funding is crucial for</span>
    <span class="line">production, distribution and ultimately, reaching a wider audience.Fundraising events provide a</span>
    <span class="line">direct avenue to connect with potential donors and sponsors who are passionate about the</span>
    <span class="line">documentary’s subject matter. While documentaries can be entertaining, focusing solely on</span>
    <span class="line">entertainment undervalues the potential for social impact and educational value that  many</span>
    <span class="line">documents possess. Fundraising should highlight the broader goals and impact of the film.</span>

    <p class="line" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Target audience:</strong> General public like students, teachers, parents, professionals, organizations</p>

    <span class="line" style="text-align: left;">The target audience for a documentary fundraising campaign should be individuals and</span>
    <span class="line">organizations who are passionate about the documentary's subject matter and who are likely to</span>
    <span class="line">be interested in supporting its broader goals and impact. This could include individuals who are</span>
    <span class="line">personally affected by the documentary's topic, organizations that work in related fields, and</span>
    <span class="line">foundations or philanthropists who support social impact initiatives.</span>

    <p class="line; &nbsp;" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Needs:</strong> Inform the audience about the crisis that Sitio Bebe is going through. Addressed the issues and seek help from other organizations, individuals, who have the advocacy with us. Promote the concert: encourage people to attend and support our fund-raising proposal.</p>
